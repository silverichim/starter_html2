            <p>Cody is a 7yr old Pembroke Corgi. He was born in Cavalier Farms, Seattle. He prefers to spend his days lounging on the bean bag. Every day, he enjoys two walks around the neighborhood and likes to make friends with other doggie friends. If lucky enough, he might see the cyclist, but he is not allowed to give chase.
                Cody loves traveling. He enjoys walking on the beach and taking sun naps. But he hates cold weather. He would like to stay at home lounging by the fireplace in winter.
